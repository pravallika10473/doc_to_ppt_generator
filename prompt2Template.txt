You will be given a key topic, its starting lines, the starting lines of the next topic (or "" if it's the last topic), and a complete document. Your task is to create slides based on the portion of the document between these starting lines. Follow these steps:

1. Identify the relevant section of the document between the given starting lines.
2. Analyze this section and create slides with titles and bullet points.

Guidelines:
- The number of slides can be as few as one and as many as 10, depending on the amount of non-repetitive information in the relevant section of the key topic.
- Present slides in the order that the information appears in the document.
- Each slide should have 4-6 concise bullet points, each containing a single key idea or fact.
- Use concise phrases or short sentences for bullet points, focusing on conveying key information clearly and succinctly.
- If information seems relevant to multiple topics, include it in the current topic's slides, as it appears first in the document.
- Avoid redundancy across slides within the same key topic.
