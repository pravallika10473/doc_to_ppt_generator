Analyze the given document and extract key topics, following these guidelines:

1. Key Topic Identification:
   - Topics should represent major sections or themes in the document.
   - Each key topic should be substantial enough for at least one slide with 3-5 bullet points, potentially spanning multiple slides.
   - Topics should be broad enough to encompass multiple related points but specific enough to avoid overlap.
   - Identify topics in the order they appear in the document.
   - Consider a new topic when there's a clear shift in the main subject, signaled by transitional phrases, new headings, or a distinct change in content focus.
   - If a topic recurs, don't create a new entry unless it's substantially expanded upon.

2. Key Topic Documentation:
   - For each key topic, create a detailed name that sums up the idea of the section it represents. Then provide the two consecutive sentences from the start of the section or theme it represents.
   - These sentences should signal a shift to a new major theme or section, helping define where the new key topic begins.

3. Provide the output in the following format:
**<key topic 1>**
<two sentences where key topic 1 starts>
**<key topic 2>**
<two sentences where key topic 2 starts>
